*I heard about the virus in Nov 2019. It seemed harmless enough. Nobody thought it was going to spread outside China. In hindsight nobody knew how contagious the virus was.*

Its 12:19 AM here and I just started writing something. The weather here in Atlanta is really unpredictable. One day it is cold and then hot the other day. I guess we more used to the Himalayas providing a protective shield against the winds, back in India. In India, the weather is more constant. But I don't fall sick here often which might be due to the lack of dust and bacteria in the atmosphere.

Its been almost a month since I have not left the house. Except to get check package deliveries from Amazon or to get the groceries from the Instacart delivery person. Washing hands after touching any potential virus-carrying surface has become second nature. However, I am way too lazy sanitize my groceries...

The death toll has reached 35k here in the US. Although, it is less than 1000 in GA. The hardest-hit states are New York and Washington. May the living find courage and the dead find peace.

I had a gut feeling that the US was not prepared for this pandemic. A country that has huge oil and weapons reserves for War is now short of ventilators and masks. The irony!. The truth is that the health system is truly broken in the US. There seems to be an aversion towards providing universal health care here. Maybe its because they believe that everybody should earn heath insurance, not hand it out.

But I think Americans will ride this out. This is because they have very strong institutions and a decentralized form of government. They work well with each other and form a cohesive government machinery. Not to mention that the private sector is very much involved in this fight. All those Billions!

As for India, we will win too. The curfew system has shown that Indians respond well to strong authority and leadership. Maybe all this Democracy is bad for our health. The whole community making sacrifices for the common good. Is nation-building any different?

The post-corona world would be very different. It would be interesting to see how countries deal with the inevitable recession that would follow this crisis. The global economy would be more internet-based. The need for physical contact would be minimized. There would be a rise in new technologies that help people work remotely. There would be new standards for maintaining public hygiene, including public places like restaurants and airports.
